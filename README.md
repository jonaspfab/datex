## Introduction

DatEx was developed to support the provision of a training dataset for the SPARCS deep learning project. This is achieved by expanding training datasets with syntheticly generated training data. The goal of the SPARCS deep learning project is the automatic recognition of small pieces in overhauling processes.

Aircrafts undergo heavy maintenance checks approximately every six years, which includes an overhauling process of the aircrafts engines. During this overhauling process the engine has to be disassembled to check all parts for signs of wear, and reassembled afterwards.
